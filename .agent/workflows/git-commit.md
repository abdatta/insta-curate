description: Updates docs and commits current changes to git with a message as per best practices

Thoroughly analyze all documentation in our repo and then update them as per recent changes if necessary. Feel free to create new docs (eg. ADRs or examples) if relevant for the current changes. Finally commit the changes with a message as per best practices.
